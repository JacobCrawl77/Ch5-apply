                <h2>Sticky</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a sticky position. Its position is based on the user's scroll position.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to briefly explain how to use the sticky position. -->
                <p><p>When you scroll down the page, this element will stick to the top of the viewport.</p></p>

            <div class="box relative">
                
                <h2>Relative</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a relative position. It can move around a little, depending on the viewport, but it is in a position relative to itself.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and left properties and how it affected the relative box. -->
                <p>The relative box is positioned with a top value of [your top value] and a left value of [your left value]. Observe how changing these values affects the position of the relative box.</p>

            <div class="box fixed">

                <p>This is an example of an element with a fixed position. Its position is relative to the viewport.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and right properties and how it affected the fixed box. -->
                <p>The fixed box is positioned with a top value of [your top value] and a right value of [your right value]. Observe how changing these values affects the position of the fixed box.</p>
                
            </div>
            
            <div class="box absolute">
                
                <h2>Absolute</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with an absolute position. It is similar to the fixed position; however, it is positioned relative to the closest parent element.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the bottom and right properties and how it affected the absolute box. -->
                <p>The absolute box is positioned with a bottom value of [your bottom value] and a right value of [your right value]. Observe how changing these values affects the position of the absolute box.</p>
